This is a starting point for JavaScript solutions to the
["Build Your Own Redis" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/redis).

In this challenge, you'll build a toy Redis clone that's capable of handling
basic commands like `PING`, `SET` and `GET`. Along the way we'll learn about
event loops, the Redis protocol and more.

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to
[codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) to try the challenge.



# test  

Note: This section is for test.

1. Ensure you have `node (21)` installed locally
2. Run `./your_program.sh` to run your Redis server, which is implemented in
   `app/main.js`.
